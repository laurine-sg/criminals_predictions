-   Univariate Numerical Analysis:

```{r}
summary(data)
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(data))
```

-   Univariate Graphical Analysis:

```{r}
# Install and load gridExtra
install.packages("gridExtra")
library(gridExtra)

# Create individual histograms
hist1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = criminals_per_100)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Criminals per 100")

hist2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = beerhouses_per_100)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Beerhouses per 100")

hist3 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = school_per_100)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "School per 100")

hist4 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = worship_per_100)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Worship per 100")

# Arrange the plots side by side
grid.arrange(hist1, hist2, hist3, hist4, ncol = 2)

```

```{r}
boxplot(data$school_per_100, data$worship_per_100,
        names = c("School", "Worship"),
        col = c("green", "purple"),
        main = "Boxplots of Continuous Variables",
        xlab = "Variable",
        ylab = "Value")

```

```{r}
boxplot(data$criminals_per_100, data$beerhouses_per_100,
        names = c("Criminals", "Beerhouses"),
        col = c("blue", "red"),
        main = "Boxplots of Continuous Variables",
        xlab = "Variable",
        ylab = "Value")

```

Boxplots are separated in two for better visualization because the scale are too different.

-   Bivariate Numerical Analysis :

```{r}
# Correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(data, use = "complete.obs")
print(cor_matrix)

```

```{r}
# Visualizing correlation
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "circle")  
```

-   Bivariate Graphical Analysis

```{r}

# Scatter plot: Beerhouses vs Criminals
plot(data$beerhouses_per_100, data$criminals_per_100, 
     main = "Criminals vs Beerhouses",
     xlab = "Beerhouses per 100", ylab = "Criminals per 100",
     col = "blue", pch = 16)  # pch=16 gives solid circles
abline(lm(criminals_per_100 ~ beerhouses_per_100, data = data), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{r}

# Scatter plot: School Attendance vs Criminals
plot(data$school_per_100, data$criminals_per_100, 
     main = "Criminals vs School Attendance",
     xlab = "School Attendance per 100", ylab = "Criminals per 100",
     col = "green", pch = 16)
abline(lm(criminals_per_100 ~ school_per_100, data = data), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{r}
# Scatter plot: Worship Attendance vs Criminals
plot(data$worship_per_100, data$criminals_per_100, 
     main = "Criminals vs Worship Attendance",
     xlab = "Worship Attendance per 100", ylab = "Criminals per 100",
     col = "purple", pch = 16)
abline(lm(criminals_per_100 ~ worship_per_100, data = data), col = "red", lwd = 2)


```
